  <p>Perhaps you've already heard that Ruby Facets is filtering it's arsenal
of code to provide ONLY core and standard library extension methods.
This means a number of classes and modules that remained in Ruby Facets
after the last "<i>MORE library clean-up</i>" have to move out. The question
is, where to?</p>

<p>Somewhat surprisingly, much of the remaining MORE library's classes and
modules fall into two categories, and based on this have found their way
into two new spin-off projects: The <a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/hashery">Ruby Hashery</a>
and <a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/mixers">Ruby Mixers</a>.
In both projects are found a small collection of nicely related libraries.
In Hashery, it is a collection of Hash-like classes. While in Mixers, it
is a collection of mixin modules. Be sure to check them out. If you were
using any of these libraries before, now you know where to find them
when Facets 3.0 comes out.</p>

<p>In some respects the great, megalithic and all-in-one
Ruby Facets will be missed. It was nice to have a single dependency for
so much functionality. But the new focus and subsequent spin-offs have
proved even more fruitful. The classes and modules in Hashery and
Mixers have already been substantially improved by the transition.
And, Facets 3.0, which will be released soon, is likewise shaping up
to be the best release ever.</p>
