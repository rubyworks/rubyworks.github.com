  <div class="title"><a href="">Is OpenHash a Bad Idea?</a></div>

  <p>A long time ago, in an now long forgotten ruby-talk thread, a poster
asked, "what's all the fuss over these open classes? If you
really need something like that just open up a Hash and add method_missing",
or something to that effect. It seemed a reasonable comment. And for some
time after I thought the poster made a good point: for simple needs
an "OpenHash" is a good light-weight solution, useful to many cases.
The basic implementation of an OpenHash is as follows.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">class</span> <span style="color:#B06;font-weight:bold">OpenHash</span> &lt; <span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">Hash</span>
    <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06B;font-weight:bold">method_missing</span>(s,*a,&amp;b)
      <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">case</span> s.to_s
      <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">when</span> <span style="background-color:#fff0ff"><span style="color:#404">/</span><span style="color:#04D">\=</span><span style="color:#808">$</span><span style="color:#404">/</span></span>
        <span style="color:#038;font-weight:bold">self</span>[s] = a[<span style="color:#00D;font-weight:bold">0</span>]
      <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">else</span>
        a.empty? ? <span style="color:#038;font-weight:bold">self</span>[s] : <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">super</span>(s,*a,&amp;b)
      <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>
    <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>

</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Very concise, very elegant, very charming. But, looks can be deceiving.
The problem lies in the fact that #method_missing catches public messages
that are undefined. So right off the bat a whole slew of hash
keys will be off-limits, notably any public method already defined by
Hash or Enumerable, Object or Kernel. That's a lot of keys.
To mitigate this problem we can either use delegation inplace of
sub-classing Hash, or we can privatize all the methods.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
  private *instance_methods.map{ |x| x.to_s !~ <span style="background-color:#fff0ff"><span style="color:#404">/</span><span style="color:#808">^__</span><span style="color:#404">/</span></span> }

</pre></div>
</div>

<p>The downside of course is that we no longer have a "Hash" and
no thus access to any of the Hash methods. So here we have a bit
of a catch-22. How much do we want OpenHash to get out of the way
of potential keys and how much do we want access to the usual set
of Hash methods?</p>

<p>Beyond this issue there is also a more subtle problem. Any core
extension method added to Hash, Enumerable (if we are sub-classing Hash),
or Object and Kernel (in either case), <em>after</em> OpenHash
has already been defined, will create another exception that can't
be anticipated. The only robust work around for this is to
make OpenHash a subclass of BasicObject, which means we will have to
use delegation and Ruby 1.9 (or an emulative BlankSlate library).</p>

<p>So now you might think, clearly these issues are the reason Ruby has
OpenStruct (ostruct.rb) rather then this simple OpenHash class.
However, it turns out that OpenStruct is little more than a delegated
OpenHash and suffers the same issues.</p>

<p>Despite these issues however it is tempting to think that simple classes
like OpenHash are okay solutions in most cases. After all, the chances
of a name clash are fairly slim. I used to think this way myself. But
one day, as I considered using an OpenHash in production code, it dawned
on me. Using a weak solution just because it's "light-weight" and will
<em>probably</em> be okay is asking for trouble. Even if all my pretty tests
passed today, a simple change tomorrow in some far off dependency could
stymie the whole works, and in such a way that it might not be so easily
noticed right away. Clearly, despite the temptation, it is much wiser
to use a more robust solution, even if it seems less elegant.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we don't need to give up on our OpenHash just yet. It turns
out there is a reasonably robust solution to it's shortcomings: We can
protect all newly defined keys.</p>

      private
      <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06B;font-weight:bold">protect_slot</span>(s)
        (<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">class</span> &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#B06;font-weight:bold">self</span>; <span style="color:#038;font-weight:bold">self</span>; <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>).class_eval <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">do</span>

    <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>

</pre></div>

<p>This will ensure that any set value will remain so, no matter what
methods are previously defined or subsequently defined in superclasses.
Great! But wait... we now run into another risk. We can't depend on any
original method always being available. The above code could even allow
<code>object_id = :you_loose</code>. Ouch! Clearly we need to add a few
exceptions. We can do this by adding a new method called #omit_slots.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
      private
      <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06B;font-weight:bold">omit_slots</span>
        [<span style="color:#A60">:__id__</span>, <span style="color:#A60">:__send__</span>, <span style="color:#A60">:object_id</span>]
      <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>
      <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06B;font-weight:bold">protect_slot</span>(s)
        (<span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">class</span> &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#B06;font-weight:bold">self</span>; <span style="color:#038;font-weight:bold">self</span>; <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>).class_eval <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">do</span>
          protected s <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">rescue</span> <span style="color:#038;font-weight:bold">nil</span>
        <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span> <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">unless</span> omit_slots.include?(s.to_sym)
      <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>

</pre></div>
</div>

<p>That will handle the most basic case. And if we need an OpenHash with
more restrictive requirements we can just override #omit_slots, either
via a singleton method or by sub-classing OpenHash. Easy.</p>

<p>This pretty much mitigates all our issues with OpenHash, though certainly
there are a few things we can yet do to spruce her up, such as define and
omit a #to_hash method. Even so, this implementation does leave us a bit
straddled in at least one respect: We have to be very precise about what
methods/keys we plan to use. That might not always be easy as we would
like. So might there be a way to have our cake and eat it too?</p>

<p>If we are willing to give up just a little of the usual elegance,
then we can. Ruby allows us to define methods ending in a <code>?</code>
mark. So we can use this for an alternate implementation to look up
values. Lets call it OpenQuery.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">class</span> <span style="color:#B06;font-weight:bold">OpenQuery</span> &lt; <span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">Hash</span>
    <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06B;font-weight:bold">method_missing</span>(s, *a, &amp;b)
      <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">case</span> s.to_s
      <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">when</span> <span style="background-color:#fff0ff"><span style="color:#404">/</span><span style="color:#04D">\?</span><span style="color:#808">$</span><span style="color:#404">/</span></span>
        <span style="color:#038;font-weight:bold">self</span>[s.to_s.chomp(<span style="background-color:#fff0f0;color:#D20"><span style="color:#710">'</span><span style="">?</span><span style="color:#710">'</span></span>).to_sym]
      <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">when</span> <span style="background-color:#fff0ff"><span style="color:#404">/</span><span style="color:#04D">\=</span><span style="color:#808">$</span><span style="color:#404">/</span></span>
        <span style="color:#038;font-weight:bold">self</span>[s] = a[<span style="color:#00D;font-weight:bold">0</span>]
      <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">else</span>
        <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">super</span>(s, *a, &amp;b)
      <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>
    <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>

</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Now we have all the feature of regular Hash, plus the elegance of an OpenStruct
so long as we end our look up methods with a question.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
  oq = <span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">OpenQuery</span>.new
  oq.foo = <span style="color:#00D;font-weight:bold">10</span>
  oq.bar = <span style="color:#00D;font-weight:bold">20</span>
  oq.foo?                 <span style="color:#888">#=&gt; 10</span>
  oq.bar?                 <span style="color:#888">#=&gt; 20</span>
  oq.map{ |k,v| v + <span style="color:#00D;font-weight:bold">10</span> }  <span style="color:#888">#=&gt; [20, 30]</span>

</pre></div>
</div>

<p>With OpenQuery we need only worry about 20 or so core methods ending
in <code>?</code>.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
    has_key? empty? instance_variable_defined? has_value? key? nil? value?
    tainted? include? instance_of? equal? all? kind_of? eql? any? is_a?
    member? one? frozen? respond_to? none?

</pre></div>
</div>

<p>If any of these are an issue, we can always add <code>#protect_slot</code> and
<code>#omit_slots</code> to this solution as well.</p>

<p>The OpenHash concept has been explored by others in the past. You can find
a rendition of it <a href="http://github.com/karottenreibe/ohash">here</a>. In this
case the author, Fabian Streitel, mitigates the name clash issue by not
sub-classing Hash. If Fabian went one step further and sub-classed
BasicObject then he'd have a pretty good solution on his hands.</p>

<p>Ruby Facets also has a class called OpenObject. It is more robust
than either OpenHash or OpenStruct in that it allows any method name
to be set, and leaves only a few methods in place such as <code>#each</code>
and <code>#to_hash</code>, but even these can, for better or worse, be
overwritten by the setter.</p>

<p>So, returning to our original question, "Is OpenHash a bad idea?", we
can happily say, "No". But only if we take great care in our design.
There is no perfect solution here. We can get pretty close, but there
are trade-offs regardless of the solution chosen. Ultimately the key is
to know exactly your needs and the potential consequences of the solution
you select, and code accordingly.</p>
