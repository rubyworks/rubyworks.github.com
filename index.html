    </div>
    <div class="btext">
      <p>A long time ago, in an now long forgotten thread, a ruby-talk poster
asked, "what's all the fuss over these open classes? If you
really need something like that just open up a Hash and add method_missing",
or something to that effect. It seemed a reasonable comment, and for some
time after that I thought this poster made a good point. For simple needs
an "OpenHash" seems like a good light-weight solution, useful to many cases.</p>

<p>The simplest implementation looks something like this:</p>

      <p>I love beautifully written code. Unfortunately the realities of the
language sometimes clash with requirements of the implementation. While
Ruby goes a long way toward making beautifully written code common place.
It still has some shortcomings I'd like to see improved.</p>

<p>Case in point are my endeaors of the last few days. I've been struggling
to re-structure the code of the <a href="http://github.com/rubyworks/english/">English</a>
project. The primary puporse of the project is to provide extension methods to String,
pertaining to the English language. A good exmample are number inflection
methods #singluar and #plural. At the same time I am trying to design
the library in such a way that other language modules can be built following
the same basic structure, and they could all work together if need be.</p>

      <p>In Ruby 1.9, Enumerable methods return an Enumerator when no block is provided them.
This makes it very convenient to chain methods in what is often called <em>fluid notation</em>.
For example, rather than the usual <code>#each_with_index</code>, one can use:</p>

      <p>Recently I set out to migrate most of my work from Rubyforge to GitHub, in so doing I needed a umbrella account to place all these
wonderfully chewy morsals. In deliberating a name for the account I recollected the very first Ruby website I had ever created back
in 2002. It was called Ruby Works and hosted at http://transami.net/ruby. It has long been defunct, but it seems fitting to bring my
waining Ruby career to a conclusion by coming full circle. And so Ruby Works was reborn.</p>

<p>In the process of this migration I made myself this nifty new blog built with <a href="http://proutils.github.com/brite">Brite</a>, my home grown
static website and weblog construction kit.</p>

<p>In any case, this website is dedicated to the many awesome Ruby projects I've had the privilege to develop and maintain over the years.
Combined with <a href="http://proutils.github.com">ProUtils</a> these cover my complete works in the Rubydom. Most of the projects are in good
working order. In fact, I've only let a couple non-useable projects into the collection, in their case because I would like to get
them working soon. All the rest good to go, some in relatviely perfect order, others still a little rough around the edges, but
still usable.</p>

<p>As time wears on I'll blog about these various projects here (now that I have this spiffy new blog). If you would like to discuss any
of these projects please hop over the the <a href="http://googlegroups.com/group/rubyworks-mailinglist">Google Group</a>. I setup the group
just for that purpose.</p>

    <div class="btext">
      <p>This is the first in a series of posts in which I plan to introduce my fellow Rubyists to the plethora or goodness that is <a href="http://facets.rubyforge.org">Ruby Facets</a>.</p>

<p>Ruby Facets has been in development for several years, starting out as a rather rag-tag collection general purpose Ruby scripts, and has evolved into the latest release, version 2.5.0, which has reached a nice level of maturity --getting pretty close, I suppose one could say, to that stately realm of "enterprise-ready".</p>

<p>Every few weeks or so, I'll pick a library or particular extension and expound upon it. While the main intent of this series is to let others know what Facets makes available to them. I will also use it as a platform to further improve and polish Facets. So please, feel free to comment, make suggestions and point out alternatives, so that Facets might better serve the Ruby community in the future.

Okay, now to the meat of this edition...

I decided to start with something quite simple, but very useful, homogenizing hash keys. Currently in Ruby, this requires code like:</p>


    </div>
    <p><a href="/2008/hash-rekey/index.html">Continue Reading</a></p>
    <!-- <small>Written by trans</small> -->

      <span class="date" style="float: right; padding-top: 5px;">2008-10-06</span>
      <a href="/2008/old-hash/index.html">This Old Hash</a>
    </div>
    <div class="btext">
      <p>The Hash may well be the most used class in Ruby. Sure, our programs
have arrays and strings galore, but they generally come and go without
much ado. Hashes on the other hand get <em>used</em>; and by that I mean to
say, we spend a lot of time fussing with them. I think there are two
significant reasons for this and I will focus on the first, and
the more important of the two, here.</p>

<p>Now, I suspect you would agree, if I were to present you with a class
which was clearly overkill for vast majority of its intended uses, and
its use required repeated mitigation of its unused features, I have no
doubt, you'd unequivocally advise me to select a "<i>better tool for the job</i>".
And yet, that's the situation all Ruby programmers face, day in and
day out, with Ruby's Hash.</p>

<p>Ruby's Hash is exceptionally powerful because it supports any type of
object as a hash key. That's really really cool... for all of about
five minutes. The truth is, the vast majority of cases only require
one type of key --for Ruby that will either be a Symbol or a String,
and because of this, a great deal of time and code is wasted ensuring
all keys are that single type. Because of this, methods like
<code>#to_sym</code> often riddle our scripts.</p>

<p>The issue is undeniably attested to by real world "solutions"
others have created to address it, such as Ruby Facets'
<a href="http://facets.rubyforge.org/doc/api/core/classes/Hash.html#M000124">Hash#rekey</a>.
and Ruby on Rails'
<a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/HashWithIndifferentAccess.html">HashWithIndifferentAccess</a>.
But let's face it, these are both underwhelming attempts at mitigating
the fundamental problem.</p>

<p>A real solution would have the current Hash class renamed, and a new
limited-key structure put in its place. The old class would still be
available, of course, for those special cases when a key of any object
type is required, but the new, more utilitarian Hash class would be
the literally-constructed default. The end effect of this change would
be simple:</p>
