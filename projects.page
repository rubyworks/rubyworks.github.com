<li><b>Baker</b>
&nbsp;[<a href="http://baker.rubyforge.org">Website</a>]
&nbsp;[<a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/baker/">Development</a>]
<br/><br/>Baker is a 100% Ruby implementation of a source-based package
management system for unix-like operating systems. It is still under heavy
development.
<br/><br/><br/>

<li>
<b>LightType</b>
&nbsp;[<a href="tomslib/tomslib.tgz">Download</a>]
&nbsp;[<a href="tomslib/doc/">API Documentation</a>]
<br/><br/>Includes a Euphoria-like type system, an implementation of 
interface contracts, and a few other additional related standard class modifications.
Useful modification Classes and Modules for Ruby itself,
such as #to_b for most classes to convert to true or false,
extra methods to NilClass so you get default values for things
like #to_f rather then an error, and a few others.
<br/><br/><br/>

<li><b>YAML/VIM</b>
&nbsp;[<a href="yamlvim/yamlvim.tgz">Download</a>]
&nbsp;[<a href="yamlvim/README">README</a>]
<br/><br/>YAML.VIM is a collection of scripts implemented in vim script and ruby.
Currenlty there are two scripts: a pury vim script for yaml syntax highlighting,
and ruby script (with a vim loader script) for alphabetically sorting map sequences.
These script are about 50% complete but work fairly well as they are.

<b>XMLToolKit</b>
&nbsp;[<a href="xmltoolkit/xmltoolkit.tgz">Download</a>]
&nbsp;[<a href="xmltoolkit/doc/">API Documentation</a>]
&nbsp;[<a href="xmlproof/xmlproof.html">xml:Proof Documentation</a>]
&nbsp;[<a href="xmlproof/xmlproof-spec.html">xml:Proof Specification</a>]
&nbsp;[<a href="xmltailor/xmltails.html">xml:Tails Specification</a>]
<br/><br/>Collection XML tools.
I've now gathered all my XML work into a single library set.
These tools are at various stages of completion. 
This library includes an assortment of tools:
<br/><br/><br/>

<ul>

  <li><b>PrettyXML</b> -
  PrettyXML is a pretty printer for XML/XHTML. It has definable indentation
  and makes for a good demonstration of REXML's stream parser, which is required.
  <br/><br/><br/>
  </li>

  <li><b>REREXML</b> -
  REREXML adds a few extra features to REXML, like absolute xpaths, both relative and indexed,
  and a parser for Namespace and Schema processing instructions (non-standard).
  <br/><br/><br/>
  </li>

  <li><b>XMLProof/Ruby</b> -
  An implementation of xml:Proof, an alternate XML schema language. xml:Proof has more features
  and is easier to use than any other schema language out there. Have your doubts? Can your schema language
  validate content based on its alphabetical order? Can your schema language require two attributes and
  three elements be present if any one of them is, even though they appear is vastly different
  sections of the document? Can your schema language validate content against Regular Expressions?
  These are just a few of the things xml:Proof can do.
  <br/><br/><br/>
  </li>

  <li><b>XMLTailor/Ruby</b> -
  An implementation of xml:Tails, an alternate XML stylesheet transformation language.
  xml:Tails is a tag attribute language for scripting languages. This implementation is obviously
  for use with Ruby, but implementations could be made for other lanuages. It it perfect for Web Developers
  who need to keep a distinct seperation between WYSIWYG Web design and underlying scripting logic.
  It also makes a good substitue for ERuby, and other web templating systems.
  Sorry, XMLTailor/Ruby is not yet available as it is alpha code and exceedingly slow, although is does work.
  Hopefully I can speed it up enough to be of reasonable use some time soon.
  <br/><br/><br/>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>SQLiX</b> -
  SQLiX is descendent of XSQL, which you may have read about in
  the Ruby's Developers Guide. SQLiX makes adavances over XSQL by allowing 
  referenced sub-records to be imported into the generated XML very easily.
  It also includes XiSQL, providing the reverse process of updating, inserting,
  and deleting properly formed XML documents against the database.
  (Note: This is an outcropping of Jigsaw, which turned out to be infeasible.)

<li>
<b>Jigsaw</b>
&nbsp;[<a href="jigsaw/jigsaw.tgz">Download</a>]
&nbsp;[<a href="jigsaw/doc/">API Documentation</a>]
<br/><br/>Jigsaw is an application framework
for creating database and/or web applications.
<br/><br/><br/>

<ul>

  <li><b>DBIze</b> -
  Behold! The power of MIXINS! DBize is a mixin module which practically 
  gives instant database connectivity to any object. Simply define a table in your
  database with field names identical to the instance variables of your object,
  add a couple very simple methods to it and mixin! Like magic, you are blessed with
  methods to load, insert, update, and delete that object's data against the database.
  <br/><br/><br/>
  </li>

  <li><b>CGIze</b> -
  ...
  <br/><br/><br/>
  </li>

  <li><b>MiterBox</b> -
  MiterBox is a mutifaceted templating system, capable of generating GUI's on demand.
  Miter uses ASCII Pictoral Templates to model GUI layout. This makes if easy, quick and fun to 
  create GUI forms. Currently, MiterBox is multifaceted, supporting a subset of capabilites for a number of GUI
  toolkits, but all primary functionality is readily handled and there are simple means for extending the
  generated layouts via Ruby script. Currently XHTML is supported, with Tk mostly funcitonal.
  BUT the whole of it will soon be retrofit to only generate GUtopIa transacation view-models.
  If anyone else wishes to have the current multifaceted version and possibly add support for other GUIs
  (GTK+, QT, FXRuby, etc.) please let me know.
  <br/><br/><br/>

</ul>

<li><b>ONI</b>
&nbsp;[<a href="oni/oni.tgz">Download</a>]
&nbsp;[<a href="oni/doc/">API Documentation</a>]
<br/><br/>ONI stands for Object Networked Interface.
It is similiar to DRb and ROMP. But unlike them,
ONI uses YAML to serialize objects. It is pre-alpha.
<br/><br/><br/>
</li>

<li><b>GUtopIa</b>
&nbsp;[<a href="gutopia/gutopia.tgz">Download</a>]
&nbsp;[<a href="gutopia/doc/">API Documentation</a>]
<br/><br/>NOTE: GUtopIa is undergoing a massive overhaul, so who knows how much of the below applies.<br/>
GUtopIa is a GUI meta-API for the Ruby scripting language. We say "meta" because it presents a single common API
to the developer regardless of the underlying base API. In sum, GUtopIa intends to provide a best-of-all-worlds GUI toolkit
to the Ruby community of programmers, meeting all requirements of such a toolkit: cross-platform compatability,
native platform integration, ease of coding with good Seperation Of Concerns and opertaing on the Principle of Least Suprise,
international font support, as well as a good dose of flexibity and speed. There are two major divisions to the GUtopIa meta-API,
tentatively nicked name Biz and Joy. Biz uses wxWindows as a backend GUI API, while Joy uses the ClanLib Game SDK.
Both are open source projects in their own right. The common meta-API as presented to the developers is desgined around
a Dual Channel Model-View-Control architecture. This structure provides optimal SOC. The core-application (Model)
need not be necessarily altered in anyway in order to give it a user-interface (View). The two are coorelated by pairs
of intermediary conduits, which are actually dynamically generated methods in the ruby source.
These shuttle state changes "automagically" between core-application and user-interface (Controller).
The GUtopIa project is an offspring of the original RougeProject, a part of FreeRIDE and continues in its footsteps
with the goal of bringing GUI programming to new heights that only a languge like Ruby can provide.
