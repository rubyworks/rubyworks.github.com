<a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/tracepoint">TracePoint</a>
is a Binding with the addition of event information. In theory
it would function very well as the join-point for AOP. In practice
it provides a much better approach to #set_trace_func. This release
(finally!) adds multi-tracing and named traces.
