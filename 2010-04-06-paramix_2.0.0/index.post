Thanks to a conversation with Jonathan Rochkind,
<a href="http://rubyworks.github.com/anise">Paramix</a>
has been completely rewritten.  Whereas anonymous modules
were avoided in prior versions, it has become clear that
the worries of memory consumption that would accompany them
were largely unfounded. The new code is refreshingly concise,
and the design fully comforms to POLS.
