  <p>Recently I set out to migrate most of my work from Rubyforge to GitHub, in so doing I needed a umbrella account to place all these
wonderfully chewy morsals. In deliberating a name for the account I recollected the very first Ruby website I had ever created back
in 2002. It was called Ruby Works and hosted at http://transami.net/ruby. It has long been defunct, but it seems fitting to bring my
waining Ruby career to a conclusion by coming full circle. And so Ruby Works was reborn.</p>

<p>In the process of this migration I made myself this nifty new blog built with <a href="http://proutils.github.com/brite">Brite</a>, my home grown
static website and weblog construction kit.</p>

<p>In any case, this website is dedicated to the many awesome Ruby projects I've had the privilege to develop and maintain over the years.
Combined with <a href="http://proutils.github.com">ProUtils</a> these cover my complete works in the Rubydom. Most of the projects are in good
working order. In fact, I've only let a couple non-useable projects into the collection, in their case because I would like to get
them working soon. All the rest good to go, some in relatviely perfect order, others still a little rough around the edges, but
still usable.</p>

<p>As time wears on I'll blog about these various projects here (now that I have this spiffy new blog). If you would like to discuss any
of these projects please hop over the the <a href="http://googlegroups.com/group/rubyworks-mailinglist">Google Group</a>. I setup the group
just for that purpose.</p>
